#ifndef EASYGL_H
#define EASYGL_H 20261001

/* =====================================================================
 * easygl.h - EasyX compatible drawing library implemented on OpenGL.
 *
 * Target   : Windows / MinGW GCC 4.9.2+ and MSVC 2015+.
 *            C flavour: C11 (-std=c11 / gnu11 / default).  C99 and C89 are
 *            not supported - see "Which C dialect" below.
 *            C++ flavour: C++11 or later, where the overloads are real.
 * Standard : strict C11. No STL, no references, no overloading, no default
 *            arguments - every EasyX "default argument" is emulated with a
 *            variadic (and, for TCHAR strings, _Generic) dispatch macro, so
 *            user code looks exactly like EasyX.
 * Encoding : this file is pure ASCII on purpose.
 *
 * Version  : EASYGL_H / EASYGL_VER / EASYGL_VERSION  (EasyX calls its own
 *            version macro EASYX_VER; here the version is carried by the
 *            include-guard macro EASYGL_H as requested.)
 *
 * Text     : every text API comes in an A (byte string) and a W (UTF-16)
 *            flavour. The A flavour decodes its input with UTF-8 first and
 *            falls back to the active ANSI code page (GBK/Big5/...), which
 *            is what fixes double byte characters such as Chinese: the old
 *            implementation baked one glyph per *byte* and produced two
 *            nonsense glyphs per Han character.
 *
 * Single translation unit: every helper is static, so include this file in
 * exactly one .c file (same rule as the original easygl.h).
 *
 * Revision 20261001 (bug fix pass)
 *   - getaspectratio() / getorigin() report what the caller PASSED to
 *     setaspectratio() / setorigin(), not the value that ended up in force.
 *     They used to return the effective one, i.e. the request times the
 *     high DPI factor, so on a 150% display
 *
 *         setaspectratio(2, 2);  getaspectratio(&x, &y);   ->  3, 3
 *
 *     which made them the only setter / getter pair in the library that
 *     was not its own inverse, and left the requested value - the one a
 *     program needs in order to re-apply it, or to compare against - with
 *     no way to read it back at all.  getwinsize() had already solved the
 *     same problem the right way: it is the inverse of setwinsize() and
 *     reports logical units at any DPI, while getwindevsize() carries the
 *     device form.  The two getters now follow it, so a set / get round
 *     trip is exact at any DPI and the value actually in force is what
 *     they return times gethighdpiscale().  Code that relied on the old
 *     behaviour has to multiply by gethighdpiscale(); to go the other way,
 *     divide.
 *
 * Revision 20260925 (bug fix pass)
 *   - InputBox() accepts the full EasyX signature again:
 *     InputBox(out, nMaxCount, prompt, title, pDefault, width, height,
 *              bHideCancelBtn) - eight arguments, matching EasyX exactly.
 *     Only five were dispatchable, so a call that passed pDefault / width /
 *     height / bHideCancelBtn did not compile.  The four trailing parameters
 *     are now honoured: pDefault
 *     pre-fills the edit box SELECTED, the way a rename field or a browser's
 *     address bar does it, so the first keystroke replaces the default
 *     outright instead of being appended to it (caret at the end) or
 *     landing in the middle and producing a mixture of the two.  Accept it
 *     with Enter, or type over it.  Keyboard messages still in flight are
 *     drained before the dialog's loop starts (gxIbDrainKeys()), and every
 *     key that is still physically down is muted until it comes back up
 *     (gxIbNoteHeld()) - so a "press P to rename" trigger, seen through
 *     GetAsyncKeyState() before its own WM_CHAR is dispatched, can neither
 *     land in the box nor auto repeat into it.  That is what made the same
 *     key press show the default on one run and "p" on the next.  width
 *     and height size the dialog (they are the WINDOW size, like EasyX, so
 *     the frame is subtracted first), and bHideCancelBtn hides the Cancel
 *     button - true, EasyX's default, leaves a single OK, so the two to five
 *     argument forms now show one button, and the default title is
 *     "InputBox".  (Older EasyX headers spell this argument bOnlyOK; it is
 *     the same value, described from the other end.)
 *     nMaxCount is enforced on the edit control with EM_LIMITTEXT, and a
 *     wide result that is too long for the caller's byte buffer is cut back
 *     a whole character at a time so a DBCS tail is never split.
 *     The prompt is measured (DT_CALCRECT + DT_WORDBREAK) instead of being
 *     clipped to a hard coded 34 px band, and a long one grows the dialog.
 *   - initgraph() calls DisableProcessWindowsGhosting(), so a window that is
 *     busy or waiting is not greyed out and labelled "not responding".
 *     That state is a timeout, not a diagnosis: DWM sends the window a
 *     WM_NULL and, if the answer is not back within a few seconds, it
 *     freezes the frame and rewrites the title bar.  Nothing else changes -
 *     the window still gets its messages and still draws.  Define
 *     GX_ALLOW_GHOSTING to keep the Windows default.
 *   - SetWorkingImage() with no argument is accepted again: it clears the
 *     working IMAGE and goes back to the window, which is what EasyX does.
 *     The implementation is renamed gxSetWorkingImage() because in C the
 *     public name has to be a dispatch macro, and a macro cannot be defined
 *     with the same name as a function it replaces - it would expand inside
 *     its own definition.  C++ keeps real overloads.  SetWorkingImage(NULL)
 *     counts as a single argument that expands to a parenthesised
 *     expression, which the argument counter cannot tell from "none", so
 *     the zero argument macro is variadic to absorb it.
 *   - getmessage(&msg, filter) works: the two argument form used to throw
 *     the ADDRESS away and wait on (BYTE)&msg, so getmessage(&msg, EX_KEY)
 *     never woke on a key.  The pointer now selects a filtered wait and the
 *     message is written into the caller's struct, as EasyX does.  A plain
 *     integer first argument keeps its old meaning (the filter itself).
 *   - optional: define GX_EASYX_HWND and declare "HWND hwnd;" at file scope
 *     and initgraph() / closegraph() keep it in step with the window, the
 *     way EasyX does.  It cannot be assigned unconditionally because the
 *     host declares hwnd AFTER including this header, so at the point
 *     initgraph() is compiled the name does not exist yet.  GetHWnd()
 *     always works and needs no macro.
 *   - new: strokepolylinef() fills a ribbon of a given width along a path in
 *     one pass, with setstrokecap() / setstrokejoin() choosing BUTT, ROUND or
 *     SQUARE ends and MITER, ROUND or BEVEL bends.  Unlike
 *     setlinestyle(PS_SOLID, thickness), which draws every segment as its own
 *     quad, one ribbon covers each pixel once, so a translucent fill stays
 *     even however sharply the path doubles back.  The outline self
 *     intersects, so it is filled under WINDING and the caller's fill mode is
 *     restored afterwards.
 *   - strokepolygon() / strokepolygonf() / fillstrokepolygon() /
 *     fillstrokepolygonf() (and the closed form used by all of them) now
 *     round EVERY corner of a closed figure.  The loop used to append only
 *     pts[0] to close the path, which left the corner at pts[0] as the
 *     junction of the head and the tail - and gxStrokeOutline() only rounds
 *     the corners that sit strictly inside the point list, so a closed
 *     figure came out with one sharp, unjoined corner while every other one
 *     was round (a five pointed star showed four round tips and one cut
 *     off).  The path now carries one segment past the start, which turns
 *     pts[0] into an interior corner; the first segment is walked twice and
 *     the outline is one polygon filled once under WINDING, so the overlap
 *     is covered once and a translucent ribbon keeps an even tone.
 *   - stroke*() paints with the LINE colour, like every other stroking call
 *     does: strokepolyline / strokepolylinef / strokepolygon / strokepolygonf
 *     take setlinecolor(), and fillstrokepolygon() fills with setfillcolor()
 *     and then rims with setlinecolor().  They used to take the fill colour,
 *     which disagreed with polygon() / polyline(); code that set the fill
 *     colour for a stroke*() call has to set the line colour instead.
 *   - rotateimage: a positive angle now rotates clockwise like EasyX / GDI,
 *     self rotation (dst == src) no longer destroys the source, the blit no
 *     longer inherits the current setrop2() mode, "highquality" really picks
 *     LINEAR filtering and the working image target is refreshed after the
 *     implicit Resize().
 *   - setrop2: R2_MASKPENNOT / R2_MASKNOTPEN and R2_MERGEPENNOT /
 *     R2_MERGENOTPEN are no longer swapped, the draw command that is still
 *     open is closed when the mode changes, and glyphs keep their shape
 *     (alpha tested) instead of turning into solid blocks.
 *   - putimage: SRCERASE / NOTSRCERASE map to the right ROP2 codes and the
 *     source rectangle is clipped to the image.
 *   - IMAGE: Resize() and loadimage(..., w, h) keep a valid magic and a valid
 *     render target, and never delete a texture that is still queued.
 *   - misc: CS_DBLCLKS, NOCLOSE, SHOWCONSOLE and INIT_RENDERMANUAL are
 *     honoured, setrendermode(RENDER_AUTO) actually presents.
 *   - setorigin / setaspectratio / setcliprgn / clearcliprgn now flush the
 *     pending batch first: vertices are queued in logical space and the
 *     projection / scissor box is applied when the batch is drawn, so
 *     primitives that were queued before the change used to jump.
 *   - clip region: the box is clamped on all four sides (a region that lies
 *     completely outside the target produced a negative glScissor() width,
 *     i.e. GL_INVALID_VALUE), and the exclusive right/bottom RECT returned
 *     by GetRgnBox() is no longer inflated by one pixel.
 *   - gxPresent() used the *current* target size for the viewport, so drawing
 *     into a smaller IMAGE and presenting showed a squeezed sub rectangle.
 *   - getimage(dst, x, y, w, h) passed the LOGICAL rectangle straight to the
 *     framebuffer reader, so with setaspectratio() / setorigin() it grabbed a
 *     completely different region than the one that was asked for.
 *   - getpixel() / gxDevToLogX/Y / floodfill truncated towards zero instead
 *     of flooring, so negative coordinates read the wrong pixel (or a pixel
 *     that should have been reported as out of range).
 *   - setaspectratio() accepted NaN / non positive values and poisoned the
 *     projection matrix with NaN (nothing drew any more).
 *   - gxPolyFill() fanned triangles from the centroid: wrong for concave
 *     polygons, and setpolyfillmode() had no effect at all.  Replaced by a
 *     scanline fill that honours ALTERNATE and WINDING.
 *   - PS_DASH / PS_DOT / PS_DASHDOT / PS_DASHDOTDOT / PS_USERSTYLE were
 *     stored but never used, so every dashed pen drew a solid line.  Dash
 *     patterns now follow the GDI system styles, scale with the pen width
 *     and keep their phase across the segments of one figure.
 *   - The hatch / pattern brush was tiled in DEVICE space (gl_FragCoord),
 *     so it neither followed setorigin() nor scaled with setaspectratio(),
 *     and BS_PATTERN did not tile at all (IMAGE textures are CLAMP).  It is
 *     now anchored in logical space and tiled with REPEAT.
 *   - g_patSx/g_patSy were dead and produced -Wunused warnings.
 *     gxInitScreenScale() was dead too; it is kept, and exposed as
 *     getinitscreenscale(), because it is wanted as a rough "how big is
 *     this display" figure - see the note there about it being a different
 *     thing from getdpi().
 *   - BS_PATTERN now tiles: the draw switches the shared IMAGE texture to
 *     REPEAT and back (hatch textures stay REPEAT, IMAGE textures are
 *     CLAMP for putimage()).
 *   - Default render mode was RENDER_MANUAL, so gxAutoPresent() never ran
 *     and a program that does not call BeginBatchDraw() / FlushBatchDraw()
 *     showed an empty window: the canvas was drawn but never presented.
 *     EasyX starts in RENDER_AUTO (a primitive becomes visible as it is
 *     drawn) and that is now the default here as well; INIT_RENDERMANUAL
 *     selects the manual mode, and graphdefaults() no longer resets the
 *     mode because EasyX treats it as a property of the window.
 *   - The auto present throttle (8 ms) used to DROP the frame it skipped, so
 *     the last primitive of a burst stayed invisible until the next event.
 *     The frame is now owed to gxPump(), which shows it before the caller
 *     blocks in getmessage() / getmessage(filter).
 *   - getmessage() did not block: it returned an all zero ExMessage when the
 *     queue was empty, so "while (1) { getmessage(); draw(); }" spun at full
 *     CPU speed and any frame counter in it ran away.  EasyX blocks until a
 *     message arrives, and so does this one now (WaitMessage() + pump).
 *     peekmessage() keeps its non blocking behaviour, and GetMouseMsg() /
 *     getmessage(MOUSEMSG*) block as well for the same reason.
 *   - GetImageBuffer() cost a full canvas round trip per call: glReadPixels
 *     (a GPU sync point) plus two extra full image passes plus two 900 kB
 *     mallocs.  EasyX hands back a pointer into real memory, so a program
 *     that repaints every pixel was several times slower here.  Reduced by:
 *       * fusing the alpha pass into the row flip (measured ~2x on that
 *         part: the row stays in cache instead of being walked twice);
 *       * reusing a scratch buffer instead of malloc / free per frame;
 *       * setimagebuffermode(GX_IMGBUF_DISCARD), which skips the read back
 *         entirely for callers that overwrite every pixel.
 *   - gradtriangle(): an easygl extension - a triangle with its own colour
 *     at each corner.  Three vertices on the GPU, where the pixel by pixel
 *     route costs a whole canvas read back plus upload.
 *   - initgraph() now hides the console unless EX_SHOWCONSOLE is given.
 *     A MinGW build without -mwindows is a /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE program, so a
 *     black cmd window sat behind the graphics window for the whole run.
 *     EasyX only keeps the console when the flag asks for it, and so does
 *     this now.  The window is hidden, not freed - ShowWindow(SW_HIDE), not
 *     FreeConsole() - so printf() / getch() keep working, and closegraph()
 *     brings it back.  showconsole() / hideconsole() are the manual form.
 *   - Alpha channel, carried by COLORREF itself.  EasyX leaves the top byte
 *     of a 0x00BBGGRR colour unused, so it is promoted to alpha:
 *
 *         setfillcolor(ARGB(128, 255, 0, 0));  solidcircle(...);   50%
 *         setfillcolor(RGB(255, 0, 0));        solidcircle(...);   opaque
 *
 *     The byte is a TRANSPARENCY:
 *
 *        0x00 = fully OPAQUE      0x80 = half     0xFF = INVISIBLE
 *
 *     so RGB(), which builds 0x00BBGGRR, is already fully opaque and needs
 *     no redefinition - every existing EasyX colour and program is correct
 *     as it stands.  The old convention read 0 as "no alpha given" and
 *     therefore also opaque, which meant "fully transparent" could not be
 *     expressed at all; that is what changed.  ARGB(0, r, g, b) is now
 *     opaque and ARGB(255, r, g, b) is invisible.
 *
 *     GL's own alpha means the opposite (coverage: 1 = solid), so the value
 *     is inverted in gxAlphaOf() - the single place the two conventions
 *     meet.  setalpha() / getalpha() speak transparency too, so 0 means
 *     solid and 255 means invisible.
 *
 *     GetImageBuffer() gives back 0x00BBGGRR like EasyX, so a pixel read
 *     from it is opaque and can be drawn straight back out.
 *
 *     Geometry and text carry alpha PER VERTEX (gxV() writes it into the
 *     vertex colour), so gradtriangle() fades each corner independently and
 *     the GPU interpolates - no extra cost, no batch split.  Textures are
 *     the exception: putimage() and the patterned brushes replace vColor
 *     with the texture outright (uUseTex 2 and 4), so for those the level
 *     comes from the per command uAlpha uniform, i.e. from setalpha().
 *
 *     The opaque path is unchanged apart from one byte test per vertex:
 *     an alpha byte of 0 or 255 writes 1.f, which is exactly what the old
 *     code hard coded, so no batch is split and no extra state is set.
 *
 *     Two caveats.  Alpha is only honoured in R2_COPYPEN - the other ROP
 *     modes run with blending off and an alpha test at 0.5, so there a
 *     level below 128 discards the primitive instead of fading it.  And
 *     ARGB(0, r, g, b) is opaque, not invisible (0 has to mean "no alpha"
 *     for RGB() to keep working); use setalpha(0) to hide everything.
 *   - MSAA anti aliasing, off by default: setaasamples(4) before or after
 *     initgraph().  This is the smallest change that smooths everything at
 *     once, because it happens below the renderer: the canvas framebuffer is
 *     rebuilt with a multisampled renderbuffer as its colour attachment, the
 *     GPU resolves on every edge, and gxMsaaResolve() folds the samples back
 *     into the plain texture with glBlitFramebuffer() before anything reads
 *     it (gxPresent, getpixel, getimage, GetImageBuffer).  No drawing code,
 *     no vertex data and no shader changes - geometry, text, images and
 *     patterns all get smoothed for free.
 *
 *     It needs GL 3.0 (or ARB_framebuffer_object, or the older
 *     EXT_framebuffer_multisample + EXT_framebuffer_blit pair; all three
 *     spellings are looked up).  Anything that is missing, or a sample count
 *     the driver refuses, silently falls back to no anti aliasing rather
 *     than failing.
 *   - setglversion(major, minor) asks for a specific OpenGL context version.
 *     It must be called before initgraph(), and it always asks for the
 *     COMPATIBILITY profile: this library's shaders are #version 120 and use
 *     varying / texture2D / gl_FragColor, and it never binds a VAO - all of
 *     which a core profile rejects, so a core context would draw nothing.
 *     If the requested version is refused the creation falls back to 3.3 and
 *     then to whatever wglCreateContext() gives, so it never fails.
 *     Requesting a newer version does NOT make drawing faster - see the note
 *     above the function.
 *   - getvendorinfo() / getrendererinfo() / getglver() / getglslver() wrap
 *     glGetString(), and getadapterinfo() / getdisplaymode() wrap
 *     EnumDisplayDevicesA() / EnumDisplaySettingsA().  All return "n/a"
 *     instead of NULL when there is no context yet, so they are safe to call
 *     at any time.  EasyX has no equivalents.
 *   - Lightweight extensions (see sections 11c, 16b, 17a and the window
 *     helpers): gradrectangle() (four corner colours, two triangles, the
 *     GPU interpolates - the rectangle form of gradtriangle());
 *     setblendmode() / getblendmode() with GX_BLEND_ALPHA / ADD / SUB /
 *     MUL / SCREEN / NONE for glow, shadow and tint effects, which EasyX
 *     cannot do at all; getfps() / getframetime() / settargetfps() so a
 *     loop can cap itself instead of spinning a core when vsync is off;
 *     setimagefilter() to switch IMAGE textures between NEAREST (crisp
 *     1:1, the old behaviour and still the default) and LINEAR (smooth
 *     scaled sprites) - this covers what MSAA cannot, because MSAA only
 *     touches the edges of geometry and does nothing for the inside of a
 *     texture; flipimage() / mirrorimage() (one flipped quad, no CPU
 *     pixels, works in place); and hidecursor() / showcursor() /
 *     setwindowalpha() / setwindowtopmost() plus their getters, which are
 *     plain Win32 one liners EasyX programs otherwise have to reach for
 *     windows.h themselves.
 *   - The blend mode is recorded per draw command (GLCmd.blend) like the
 *     ROP and the alpha, so changing it closes the open batch instead of
 *     silently repainting primitives that were queued earlier.  All modes
 *     need blending on, so they are ignored outside R2_COPYPEN, exactly
 *     like alpha.
 *   - gxPresent() only set uUseTex, so the uAlpha / uNoBlend uniforms still
 *     held whatever the last command left.  A primitive drawn with a
 *     non COPYPEN rop at an alpha below 128 therefore made the next
 *     present discard the whole frame (uNoBlend 1 + c.a < 0.5): black or
 *     frozen window.  The blit now forces both uniforms.
 *   - cleardevice() cleared to hard coded black instead of the current
 *     background colour, so setbkcolor(WHITE); cleardevice(); stayed
 *     black - and disagreed with the clear*() family, which always used
 *     g_gx_bkColor.  It now clears with g_gx_bkColor like EasyX.
 *   - gxImageAlloc() leaked the texture when framebuffer creation failed:
 *     the early return left img->tex set while the magic (the only thing
 *     that makes gxImageDestroy() free it) was still zero.
 *   - EasyX compatibility pass (see section 18b): setaspectratio() accepts
 *     the negative factors EasyX allows (setaspectratio(1, -1)), initgraph()
 *     returns HWND and understands the EX_* flags, drawtext() returns the
 *     text height, and the missing EasyX APIs were added: getaspectratio,
 *     graphdefaults, the clear* family, polybezier, settextstyle,
 *     gettextstyle, GetImageBuffer, setcapture / releasecapture,
 *     flushmessage(filter), PeekMouseMsg, FlushBatchDraw(rect),
 *     GetEasyXVer, the colour model helpers and the graphics.h leftovers
 *     (bar, bar3d, drawpoly, fillpoly, getcolor, setcolor, getmaxx,
 *     getmaxy, setwritemode).  The argument counting macro used by the C11
 *     dispatch only worked up to 8 arguments and silently broke on more.
 *   - Newly allocated storage is UNDEFINED, so a window that had only just
 *     been created showed whatever that memory last held - speckles that
 *     stayed until the program called cleardevice().  glTexImage2D(..., NULL)
 *     and glRenderbufferStorage*() both leave the contents undefined, so
 *     initgraph() and every window resize now clear the canvas to g_gx_bkColor
 *     (after gxApplyWindowState() / gxMsaaCreate(), because with MSAA on it
 *     is the multisample renderbuffer that is drawn), and gxImageAlloc()
 *     clears a fresh IMAGE to opaque black.  EasyX hands both over already
 *     in the background colour.
 *   - cleardevice() cleared to hard coded black instead of g_gx_bkColor.
 *   - setwinsize() and getwinsize() disagreed about units: the setter takes
 *     logical units and scales them by the DPI factor, while the getter
 *     reported raw device pixels, so setwinsize(1024, 768) followed by
 *     getwinsize() came back as 1536x1152 on a 150% display.  getwinsize()
 *     is now the inverse of setwinsize() and reports logical units at any
 *     DPI; getwindevsize() is the new device pixel form.
 *   - Performance pass on the hot path (nothing about it changes what is
 *     drawn - the batching model, the number of draw calls and the vertex
 *     data are exactly as they were):
 *       * gxFlush() re-allocated the vertex buffer with glBufferData() every
 *         single time.  That call does not just copy, it allocates, and the
 *         driver may either really reallocate or stall until the GPU is done
 *         with the old store.  The capacity is now remembered and the common
 *         case - the same buffer reused frame after frame - goes through
 *         glBufferSubData(), which only copies.  The capacity grows by
 *         doubling, so a frame that keeps getting slightly bigger does not
 *         reallocate on every one of them.
 *       * Per command GL state is cached: uniforms, the bound texture and
 *         the ROP are only set when they differ from what is in force.  A
 *         frame of plain fills repeats the same values for every command,
 *         and glUniform*() / glBindTexture() are not free at thousands of
 *         calls per frame.  The first command of every flush always sets
 *         everything, because GL state is global and gxPresent(),
 *         gxClearFbo() and rotateimage() all touch it in between.  The
 *         texture filter is cached per bound texture - it belongs to the
 *         texture, so binding a different one invalidates it (without that,
 *         two putimage() calls on one image with different filters would
 *         have kept the first one's).
 *       * The byte to float colour conversion in gxV() was switched to a
 *         multiply by 1/255 and then switched back: measured on 200000 quads
 *         the multiply was 2% SLOWER, so it divides by 255 again.
 *       * Quads are now 4 vertices plus 6 indices instead of 6 vertices.
 *         Rectangle fills, putimage() and text are all quads, and a tile
 *         map is nothing but quads, so this removes a third of the vertex
 *         work in the cases that dominate.  The index pattern is
 *         precomputed once (it only depends on the absolute vertex number)
 *         and only the part that is new is uploaded.  A batch cannot mix
 *         quads with the fans and strips of the circle and polygon code, so
 *         gxV() and gxQuad*() each close the batch before switching, and
 *         every batch starts on a multiple of 4 vertices - at most three
 *         padding vertices, which no command covers, so they are never
 *         drawn.  Expanding a command through the index pattern gives
 *         exactly the triangles the old layout did.
 *       * The automatic flush threshold was lowered to 50000 and then put
 *         back to 300000: a 120000 vertex frame uploads once at 300000 and
 *         three times at 50000, and smaller uploads are not cheaper here.
 *         splitting the batch earlier costs nothing because it is replayed
 *         in one go once it is flushed anyway.

/*======================================================================
 *  Colour model
 *====================================================================*/
/* A colour is a 32 bit COLORREF, exactly as in EasyX:
 *
 *       0xAABBGGRR, which in memory on a little endian machine runs
 *       RR GG BB AA from the lowest address upwards.
 *
 *   - The bit layout is what every macro below uses:
 *
 *         bits  0..7  = red      (the LOW byte)
 *         bits  8..15 = green
 *         bits 16..23 = blue
 *         bits 24..31 = alpha    (the HIGH byte)
 *
 *     So the low byte is R and the high byte is A.  Written the other way
 *     round that is 0xAARRGGBB, the spelling most other libraries use,
 *     where the FIRST byte of the literal is alpha and the last is blue.
 *     RGB(r,g,b), GetRValue(), GetGValue() and GetBValue() are the
 *     ordinary Win32 macros and keep working unchanged.
 *
 *   - Bits 24..31 are the alpha channel, and it is a TRANSPARENCY:
 *
 *         0x00 = fully opaque      0x80 = half      0xFF = invisible
 *
 *     RGB() builds 0x00BBGGRR, so it yields an opaque colour with no extra
 *     work.  ARGB(a,r,g,b) and RGBA(r,g,b,a) build one explicitly, and
 *     GetAValue() reads the byte back.
 *
 *   - BGR(c) swaps red and blue and keeps the alpha byte intact.
 *
 *   - HSLtoHSV() / HSVtoHSL() convert between the two colour models, and
 *     HSLtoRGB() / RGBtoHSL() (and the HSV pair) go to and from a COLORREF.
 *
 * OpenGL means the opposite: its alpha is COVERAGE, where 1.0 is solid.
 * gxAlphaOf() converts with (255 - a) / 255, and that is the single place
 * the two conventions meet.  setalpha() and setwindowalpha() apply the same
 * inversion to their argument, so every "alpha" in this library - a colour
 * byte, a setalpha() level, a window opacity - is a transparency.

 * Which C dialect, and what the EasyX style overloads may use
 *====================================================================*/
/* EasyX is a C++ library: outtextxy(x, y, "s") and outtextxy(x, y, L"s") are
 * two overloads and putimage() takes anywhere from three to eight arguments.
 * Neither overloading nor default arguments exist in C, so this header
 * emulates them - a variadic macro counts the arguments and picks an
 * implementation, and string arguments are routed to the A or the W entry
 * point.
 *
 * The C flavour of this header is C11, unconditionally.  The two things that
 * need it are _Generic, which is how a string argument is told apart from a
 * wide string (and a single char from a string), and _Static_assert, which
 * checks the layouts the polygon cores rely on.  Both are C11 and neither
 * has a substitute:
 *
 *   - A sizeof test cannot route strings.  ExMessage and MOUSEMSG are both
 *     24 bytes, and 'A' is an int with no elements at all, so
 *     outtextxy(x, y, 'A') and peekmessage(&mm) on a MOUSEMSG would both be
 *     unresolvable.
 *   - __builtin_choose_expr is no help either: it still type checks the
 *     branch it discards, so the wrong arm warns.
 *
 * C99 is therefore not supported.  Neither is C89 - variadic macros do not
 * exist before C99, so the default arguments that make putimage(x, y, &img)
 * work cannot be emulated at all, and the header additionally uses inline,
 * <stdbool.h>, long long, // comments, declarations after statements and
 * for loop declarations throughout.
 *
 * Build with -std=c11 (or gnu11, or the default, which is a gnu mode).
 * MinGW GCC 4.9+ and MSVC 2015+ (/std:c11) are both fine.
 *
 * GX_HAS_GENERIC is 1 and is only reported, not tested - it used to switch
 * to a sizeof based fallback, and that fallback is gone.  GX_NO_GENERIC
 * forces 0 for the test build, which is how the no _Generic path used to be

/*======================================================================
 *  6b. User supplied post processing shader
 *
 *  gxPresent() finishes by drawing one quad carrying the finished canvas.
 *  setpostshader() swaps the fragment shader of that one draw, which is
 *  enough for anything that only needs to transform the finished picture:
 *  colour grading, blur, scanlines, vignettes, distortion, or a field
 *  computed per pixel on the GPU.
 *
 *  It deliberately does NOT touch g_gx_prog, so every EasyX drawing call
 *  (circle, putimage, outtextxy ...) keeps its own well defined behaviour.
 *  Replacing that program would mean reimplementing the uUseTex branches
 *  that solid fills, textures, hatch patterns and text all depend on.
 *
 *  The vertex shader is always the built in GX_VS.  The quad covers the
 *  whole viewport, so the shader gets:
 *
 *      varying vec2 vUV;          0..1 over the canvas, (0,0) bottom left
 *      varying vec2 vPos;         -1..1 clip space, handy for effects
 *                                 that are centred on the window
 *      uniform sampler2D uTex;    the finished canvas, texture unit 0
 *      uniform vec2  uTexel;      1/size of the canvas, for neighbours
 *      uniform float uTime;       seconds since the first frame
 *      uniform mat4  uProj;       identity during this pass
 *
 *  Any other uniform is the caller's: look it up with getpostloc() and
 *  feed it with setpost1f() and friends.  #version 120 only - this is a
 *  compatibility profile context, so use texture2D() and gl_FragColor.

 *
 * Will this make drawing faster?  Almost certainly not, and it is worth
 * being blunt about why:
 *
 *   - Frames here are bounded by fill rate, memory bandwidth and how much
 *     work the CPU submits.  A higher version number changes none of them.
 *     Every draw goes through one shader and one glDrawArrays() call; 4.6
 *     does not execute that path faster than 3.3.
 *   - Worse, "newest available" on Windows usually means a CORE profile
 *     context, and this library would break on one: the shaders are
 *     #version 120 and use varying / texture2D / gl_FragColor (all removed
 *     in core), and nothing ever binds a VAO, which core requires.  A core
 *     context would give a black window and GL_INVALID_OPERATION.
 *
 * So the request is always for the COMPATIBILITY profile, and the useful
 * reasons to call this are feature access (a newer extension, a debug
 * context) - not speed.  For speed see gradtriangle() (fewer draw calls),
 * setimagebuffermode(GX_IMGBUF_DISCARD) (no read back) and setaasamples(0).
 *
 * The request is best effort: if the driver refuses, creation falls back to
 * 3.3 and then to the default context, so this can never break a program.
 * Compare getglmajor()/getglminor() against what you asked for to find out

 * that Windows wants, and back again.
 *
 * It defaults to CP_ACP, the system ANSI code page - which is what an
 * ordinary EasyX program gets, and is the right thing for a Chinese
 * Windows where that is GBK.  setglcp() changes it, which is the only way
 * to draw text that is in some other encoding.
 *
 * Byte strings (char*) are decoded with this code page and nothing else -
 * there is no guessing.  A GBK string can be valid UTF-8 by accident: the
 * bytes CB AB D4 B2 D7 B6 are perfectly ordinary GBK text, yet they decode
 * cleanly as three UTF-8 two-byte sequences, so the old try-UTF-8-first
 * rule silently produced U+02CB U+0532 U+05D6 instead.  Text that happened
 * to form a legal UTF-8 stream was mangled while its neighbours were fine,
 * which is impossible to diagnose from the outside.
 *
 * So setglcp(936) makes GBK text work, and setglcp(CP_UTF8) makes UTF-8
 * text work.  Wide strings (wchar_t*) never reach this code at all - they
 * go straight to the W flavours - so L"..." is always unambiguous.
 *
 * Define GX_GUESS_UTF8 to put the old try-UTF-8-first behaviour back.

 *
 *   GLF_UNLIMITED (default) - the pen advances by the exact fractional
 *       advance and quads land on fractional device pixels.  GL filters
 *       the atlas across the subpixel offset, so text moves smoothly and
 *       stays correct at any setaspectratio().  Slightly soft edges are
 *       the price - a glyph can straddle two pixel rows and each row gets
 *       a partial sample.
 *
 *   GLF_INT - every glyph origin is snapped to a whole DEVICE pixel and
 *       each advance is rounded to a whole device pixel, so the bitmap is
 *       blitted 1:1 onto the pixel grid.  This is what EasyX / GDI do,
 *       and it is the sharpest possible result: crisp stems, no filtering
 *       blur.  The trade off is that text can no longer move in
 *       sub-pixel steps, and with a fractional setaspectratio() the
 *       spacing is quantised, so long lines drift a little from the
 *       true typographic width.
 *
 * Note that snapping is done in DEVICE space (after the scale and origin
 * are applied), which is the only place a "pixel" is meaningful - the
 * same x in logical units is not a whole pixel at every scale. */

 * sides offset from the spine, plus the arcs that round off the end caps
 * and the outer side of every bend.  It is filled once, so each pixel of
 * the ribbon is covered exactly once and a translucent fill comes out with
 * an even alpha however sharply the path doubles back on itself.
 *
 * The outline self intersects whenever the path turns sharply, so it is
 * filled under the WINDING rule; under the default ALTERNATE a fold comes
 * out as a hole.  The caller's fill mode is put back afterwards.
 *
 * Caps and joins carry their usual stroke meaning:
 *   GX_CAP_BUTT    the ribbon ends on the cross section at the end point
 *   GX_CAP_ROUND   a half disc of radius width/2 is added
 *   GX_CAP_SQUARE  the ribbon runs width/2 past the end point
 *   GX_JOIN_BEVEL  the two offset sides are joined straight across
 *   GX_JOIN_ROUND  an arc of radius width/2 rounds off the outer side
 *   GX_JOIN_MITER  the two offset sides are extended to where they meet,
 *                  falling back to BEVEL past GX_STROKE_MITER_MAX

 * Why the width is an argument instead of "whatever setlinestyle() says":
 * a ribbon and a pen are not the same thing.  setlinestyle() also carries
 * the DASH pattern, and stroke*() has no dashes at all - it always paints
 * one solid ribbon, which is the entire point of it (see the note at the
 * top of this section).  So the pen supplies the DEFAULT width - its
 * thickness, i.e. what setlinestyle(PS_SOLID, n) set - and the last
 * argument overrides it.  These two are the same shape at the same width:
 *
 *   setlinestyle(PS_SOLID, 26);
 *   strokepolygon(p, 5);          /  strokepolygon(p, 5, 26.0);
 *
 * Every one of them paints with the LINE colour (setlinecolor()), because
 * a ribbon is a STROKE, exactly like polygon() / polyline() do.  The fill
 * colour is only used by fillstrokepolygon(), and only for its inner part.
 * A closed ribbon gets a join at the closing corner and NO end caps.

/* Give the window a resizable frame (WS_THICKFRAME | WS_MAXIMIZEBOX), or

 * EXPERIMENTAL.  It works, but it makes the window size something the
 * program no longer controls, and everything in this library was written
 * on the assumption that initgraph() settles the size once and for all.
 * Read the notes below before using it.
 *
 * May be called before or after initgraph():
 *   - before: the flag is remembered and the window is created with the
 *     frame already in place, so there is no visible flicker;
 *   - after:  the frame of the live window is changed with SetWindowLong()
 *     + SWP_FRAMECHANGED.  The client area keeps its size, so no resize
 *     happens on this call.
 *
 * What the program has to do
 * --------------------------
 *   int w, h;
 *   getwinsize(&w, &h);        - the current LOGICAL size, every frame
 *
 * The canvas is rebuilt to the new size, so getwinsize() / getwindevsize()
 * and getwidth() / getheight() all follow the window.  Nothing is scaled:
 * the picture is not stretched to fit, the drawing surface simply becomes
 * bigger or smaller, so layout has to be computed from the current size
 * rather than from the numbers passed to initgraph().  A program that
 * caches those numbers once will draw into the wrong place after a resize.
 *
 * The canvas is cleared to the background colour - see gxResizeCanvas() for
 * why it is the whole canvas and not only the part the window gained.  In
 * other words a resize discards the picture, so anything drawn outside the
 * main loop has to be drawn again.  In RENDER_AUTO (the default) a loop that
 * redraws every frame needs no extra code.
 *
 * A WM_SIZE is pushed to the message queue on every resize, so a program
 * that wants an event instead of polling can watch for it with
 * peekmessage(&m, EX_WINDOW) and compare m.message against WM_SIZE - or
 * simply call peekvariablemsg() / waitvariablemsg(), which do exactly that.
 * Neither one carries the size: read it with getwidth() / getheight().
 *
 * Order
 * -----
 *   Calling this BEFORE initgraph() is the clean way: the window is then
 *   built with the frame already on, so nothing has to be re-measured.
 *   Calling it afterwards still works - the frame grows outward so the
 *   client area (and therefore the coordinate space) is kept - but it is
 *   a second SetWindowPos() and, on a window that cannot grow, a canvas
 *   rebuild.
 *
 * Limits
 * ------
 *   - Dragging a border puts DefWindowProc() into a modal loop that
 *     suspends the program, so nothing is presented mid-drag; the frame is
 *     repainted by the WM_PAINT handler and the picture resumes when the
 *     drag ends.
 *   - Nothing clamps the size.  A very small window makes g_gx_devW / g_gx_devH
 *     small, which is legal but may make the content unreadable, and a
 *     canvas has to be allocated at whatever size is asked for.
 *   - The maximise button is turned on even when initgraph() was given
 *     EX_NOMINIMIZE; this call is the more specific request and wins. */
/* Make the live window's frame agree with g_gx_varWinSize.  Split out of
 * variablewinsize() because a rebuilt window needs the frame back too: it
 * is a per-window property exactly like vsync, MSAA, the image filter and
 * the DPI fix, so gxApplyWindowState() - the "reapply everything after a
 * rebuild" hook - calls this along with them.  Without it the flag would
 * only ever be honoured by the one CreateWindowEx() call inside
 * gxInitGraph(), and any other rebuild would silently drop the frame.
 *
 * Idempotent, which is what makes it safe to run on every rebuild: when
 * the style already matches, the rect asked for below is the one the
 * window already has, so SetWindowPos() changes nothing, no WM_SIZE
 * arrives and the canvas is left alone. */

/*======================================================================
 *  20. GPU mesh interface  (EASYGL extension, no EasyX counterpart)
 *====================================================================*/
/* Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * A software rasteriser has to pay for every pixel on every frame: shade
 * it, then hand the finished frame to the GPU as a texture.  A 1280x720
 * canvas is 921600 pixels, so that is 3.7 MB of upload per frame on top of
 * the CPU shading -- and it is the reason a voxel world crawls while the
 * same hardware runs Minecraft at hundreds of frames per second.
 *
 * The world is static.  That is what makes the fix possible: upload the
 * geometry once, then let the GPU replay it with one draw call per frame.
 * No CPU shading, no upload, no per pixel work at all.
 *
 * Three calls a frame:
 *
 *     if (gxmeshbegin()) {
 *         gxmeshdraw(mesh, mvp, atlas);
 *         gxmeshend();
 *     } else {
 *         ... software fallback ...
 *     }
 *
 * gxmeshbegin() returns false forever if the driver cannot do it, so the
 * fallback is a normal supported path and not dead code.
 *
 * State hygiene
 * -------------
 * easygl keeps vertex attribute arrays 0/1/2 enabled and pointed at its
 * own vertex buffer, and OpenGL ignores the fixed function arrays whenever
 * a generic array of the same index is enabled.  A mesh therefore gets its
 * own VAO, which carries its own attribute bindings and cannot be clobbered
 * by easygl's calls.  Where VAOs are unavailable the enable bits are saved
 * and restored instead.  Everything else -- program, framebuffer, viewport,
 * viewport, blend, depth, texture unit -- is saved and restored too, so
 * easygl's 2D drawing is unaffected.

/*=================== raw OpenGL escape hatch ====================*/
/* Everything easygl draws goes through one shader and one vertex format, and
 * it remembers the GL state it set so it does not set it twice.  Code that
 * reaches past that and calls GL directly therefore has to do two things:
 * let the pending batch out first, so the two are not interleaved, and put
 * the state back, because the cache still believes it is in place.
 * glbegin()/glend() do exactly that and nothing else.
 *
 *   if (glbegin()) {
 *       glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION); glLoadIdentity(); ...
 *       glColor3f(1.f, 0.f, 0.f);
 *       glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES); glVertex2f(0, 0); ... glEnd();
 *       glend();
 *   }
 *
 * Inside the pair: the bound framebuffer is the canvas (getcanvasfbo()), the
 * viewport covers the whole canvas in device pixels, the easygl program is
 * unbound, the vertex array object is unbound and every generic vertex
 * attribute array is off -- so the fixed pipeline, glBegin/glVertex/glColor,
 * the matrix stack, glTexImage2D and friends all behave the way a plain
 * GL 1.1 program expects them to.  That is the whole point: easygl leaves
 * 236 of the 261 GL 1.1 entry points untouched, and this is how you get at
 * them without touching a pixel of easygl's own plumbing.
 *
 * Rules, both real:
 *   - Do not call easygl drawing functions inside the pair.  glbegin() has
 *     already flushed the batch; anything you queue would be flushed again
 *     behind glend()'s back and would land on top of your own geometry.
 *     Do the GL, call glend(), then draw with easygl.
 *   - The pair does not nest and is not reentrant.  glbegin() returns false
 *     when GL is not up yet or a pair is already open, so always test it.
 *
 * Anything past GL 1.1 is not exported by opengl32.dll on any Windows
 * machine - Microsoft has never updated that export table - so those
 * entry points have to be fetched at run time, hence glgetproc().
 * How much your own GL/gl.h declares is a separate question that depends
 * on what you installed; it decides whether you need an extern, not
 * whether you need a pointer.
 */

/* A GL 1.1-era gl.h has none of these.  Each is guarded so a newer SDK
 * that does declare them keeps its own value and there is no
